# MammutAPI
üêòMastodon's Unofficial Swift Framework

This is yet another attempt to create a `Swift` framework for [`Mastodon`][mastodon]'s social network.

I decided to build this because I wanted to create a very specific `iOS` application and at the same time I decided that creating the building blocks for the client should be `OSS` so that everyone can benefit and contribute to it.



# SwiftPackageManager

‚ÄãSince I first thought about creating the `API` for [`Mastodon`][mastodon] I always considered making it compatible with `SwiftPackageManager` and `Linux` :penguin: environments.



Because of this the project is being tested on `TravisCI` using a `Linux` image and with:

```console
swift build
swift test
```
