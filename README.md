# MammutAPI
üêòMastodon's Unofficial Swift Framework

This is yet another attempt to create a `Swift` framework for [`Mastodon`][mastodon]'s social network.

I decided to build this because I wanted to create a very specific `iOS` application and at the same time I decided that creating the building blocks for the client should be `OSS` so that everyone can benefit and contribute to it.

<br/>

üöß The project is still a WIP. I'll be adding a `TODO` down on this file to keep track of what the `API` is capable ATM and thus be able to be used üöß

# SwiftPackageManager

‚ÄãSince I first thought about creating the `API` for [`Mastodon`][mastodon] I always considered making it compatible with `SwiftPackageManager` and `Linux` :penguin: environments.



Because of this the project is being tested on `TravisCI` using a `Linux` image and with:

```console
swift build
swift test
```

# TODO

There's a [`TODO`][todo] file detailing what endpoints and methods are already covered by this framework
